# 3\. Message Definition And Transaction Flow

## 3.1 Overview

This document is API interface to do payment or topup. This API specification will be used for all implementation of payment feature in Artajasa.

# 4\. Transaction Flow

On general, transaction between Collecting Agent, Artajasa and Biller is illustrated below.

## 4.1 Timeout Flow

We can categorize timeout flow to timeout of payment and timeout of non-payment (example, inquiry).  
For timeout of non-payment, the request can be reinitiated by sending new request in another session.

For timeout of payment, client or sender can check the request using API status. As alternative, client can wait for report transaction on next day, to know whether transaction request is received by destination or not. Same biller support to reverse transaction, it can also be used if payment timeout occur.

For PLN Prepaid timeout of payment, client or sender shall send API advice.

If client or sender get negative response or no response of advice, retry advice shall be sent automatically. Retry advice shall be sent three times. If still get negative response or no response of advice, client or sender shall performe manual advice. And if still get negative response or no response of manual advice, the transaction is suspect and receipt of suspect shall be printed.  
Retry advice shall be sent within 30-35 seconds.

# 5\. Message Formats

This section of the System Requirement Specifications Manual describes the message formats for New Gate system.

The message format charts provided in this section of the manual use the following notations to identify individual data element usage requirements.

The field name on the API is case sensitive.

| **Notation** | **Interpretation** |
| --- | --- |
| M | "Mandatory": The data element is mandatory, and must be provided in the message by the message originator |
| C | "Conditional": The data element is conditionally required to be provided by the sender when specific conditions are applicable. |
| O | “optional”: The data elements is optional to be sent |

## 5.1. Postman Sample

For the following API:

- Inquiry
    
- Payment
    
- Check Status
    

There is a **Postman collection** that can be downloaded to look at the sample Request and Response as well as simple scripts simulating how some fields involved in this specification should behave in live environment. The name of the collection is:
